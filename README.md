# Coreform Cubit Examples

This repository contains worked examples of meshing models in Coreform Cubit, that aren't otherwise distributed with Coreform Cubit or its documentation.
In particular, examples (will) include those derived from webinars and short-courses that are themselves distributed outside the Coreform Cubit distribution.
